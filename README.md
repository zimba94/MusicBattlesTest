# MusicBattlesTest
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print “Music”. For multiples of 5 print “TI”. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “Musical”. But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary operators or `else`. # Requirements * 1 if * You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary * Unit tests * Feel free to apply your SOLID knowledge * You can write the challenge in any language you want. We are big fans of NodeJS, Javascript and TypeScript.

*Run Test*
